FIRE IN THE HOLE
Webpage available at: https://notskriblio.onrender.com/

Plans for changes:
- Make something show up when the game ends
   - Display final rankings
   - Players stay in the game, but their scores are reset
- undo/redo buttons (hard to implement)
- Make score show only when the current round ends
- reset room when game ends
- Add icon to the site
- Make clicking without dragging on the canvas draw a circle
Bugs:
- Lobbies can be abused by manually changing view of the page to join lobbies repeatedly
