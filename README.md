FIRE IN THE HOLE
Webpage available at: https://notskriblio.onrender.com/

Plans for changes:
- Make something show up when the game ends
   - Display final rankings
- undo/redo buttons
- Make score show only when the current round ends
- issues when joining game late
- make it clearer which player you are in the player list
- error with active user not being changed properly when the active user leaves (cannot read properties of null)
- Make player scores show up if you join lobby late (Currently all show up as 0 initially)
- reset room when game ends
Bugs:
- Players joining the room late do not see the scores of previous players until they gain new points
- Players joining the room late see other players as having their own username
